# 🚀 Phase Roadmap for Productivity Assistant

## **Phase 0 – Scaffolding & Setup**

* GitHub repo structure
* CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for automated builds
* Base SQLite + Parquet storage
* Local server for agent communication (Python FastAPI or Flask)
* Minimal logging (active window, timestamps)
  ✅ Output: a working skeleton with “hello world” logs + build pipeline

---

## **Phase 1 – Data Capture Agents**

* **Window Agent** → foreground app tracking
* **Input Agent** → keystroke/mouse counts + idle detection
* **Browser Agent** → Chrome extension, domain tracking
* Local storage: clean DB schema
* Simple dashboard: timeline of app usage
  ✅ Output: raw usable data, minimal visualization

---

## **Phase 2 – State Classification & Rules**

* **Feature Agent** → derive metrics (dwell, switches, idle%)
* **State Agent** → classify into {deep work, shallow work, drifting, AFK}
* **Rule-based Nudges** (deterministic):

  * Drifting → “Want to refocus?”
  * Idle → “Take a break?”
* Overlay UI (Tauri pill + expandable card)
  ✅ Output: system now *reacts* to your behavior in real time

---

## **Phase 3 – Agentic AI Coach**

* Local LLM integration (Phi-3 / Mistral via Ollama)
* Define **tools** (`mute_site`, `start_pomodoro`, `show_message`)
* Reasoning agent selects best tool per context
* **Policy Guard** → blocks unsafe/annoying actions
  ✅ Output: a real **AI Coach agent** with reasoning + friendly chat

---

## **Phase 4 – Insights & Dashboard**

* Focus Index metric (composite score)
* Daily reports: time in states, nudges given
* Weekly reports: deep work heatmaps, top distractions
* Evaluator Agent → logs nudge → outcome correlation
* Learning loop (multi-armed bandit: which strategies work best for you)
  ✅ Output: dashboard feels like a quantified-self “lab”

---

## **Phase 5 – Advanced UX & Controls**

* Meeting detection (Zoom/Teams → suppress nudges)
* Nudge budgeting (limit per day, decay if declined)
* User controls: pause/resume, toggle each agent, retention policy
* More polished overlay UI (animations, themes)
  ✅ Output: refined, friendly companion you can proudly release

---

## **Stretch (Optional if time permits)**

* Audio Agent → cough/voice detection → break nudges
* Camera Agent → posture/fatigue estimation
* Signed installers for public release

---

# 🏁 Final Deliverable

A **desktop productivity assistant** that:

* Runs as a tray app + overlay UI
* Collects & analyzes activity locally
* Nudges intelligently using an agentic AI coach
* Shows insights via dashboards
* Is fully installable via an MSI/EXE from your GitHub
